**[CS 1420 Fall 2021] Carrot Defense -- A Rabbits' Battle**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Carrot Defense is a fun and challenging tower defense game that 
adds a unique twist to the popular "monkey/balloon" genre. You are 
tasked with defending your precious award-winning carrot garden 
from ravenous rabbits. 

This project was made in my CS 1420 class to practice Java, the 
Eclipse IDE, and object-oriented programming. All artwork was
created by me. A picture of the starting screen is seen below.
